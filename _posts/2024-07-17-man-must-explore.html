<p>한가지 느낀건 github로 blog 하려면 markdown을 배워야 할 것 같다...</p>

<p>이것도...vi 말고 visual source code로 갈아타고...</p>

<p>뭐라 주절주절 궁시렁 궁시렁...</p>

<p>이미지는 어떻게 올리지? 배워야 할게 한가득이네...</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
